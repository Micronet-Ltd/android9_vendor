MDTP SetupWizard
================

MDTP SetupWizard is a JAVA application  which runs on first system boot (or after data partition wipe). MDTP setup wizard is intended for demo purpose and so is disabled by default.
To enable it add "mdtp.setupwizard.enable=1" to /system/build.prop file. This can be done by changing the system image sources for build.prop or by updating the file directly on the system partition of the device.

Enabling MDTP SetupWizard on device:
-------------------------------------

adb root && adb wait-for-device && adb remount
adb pull /system/build.prop ./
#now edit the local copy build.prop file and add "mdtp.setupwizard.enable=1" line
adb push ./build.prop /system/
adb sync
#setupwizard will be enable on the next boot

MDTP SetupWizard scenarios:
----------------------------

There are two main scenarios for MDTP SetupWizard. Note, that the wizard has to be enabled via the system property first, as shown above.
1) Sign-up screen
  - Presented to the user on the first boot if the device MDTP state is disabled.
  - Allows user to configure MDTP or skip the activation
  - Wizard disables itself and will not run on next boot
2) Factory reset protection screen
  - Presented to the user on the first boot if the device MDTP state is enabled.
  - The dialog blocks the device from continuing the boot process until MDTP is disabled or successfully re-validated
  - If previous step was successful wizard disables itself and will not run on next boot, otherwise wizard will continue to present reset protection screen after reboot and block the device


Demo flows
----------

(require that MDTP SetupWizard is enabled via the system property as shown above)

1) Enable MDTP on first boot setup:
  - Make sure the MDTP was NOT activated on the device
  - Wipe / reset data partition
  - Boot the device
  - Sign-up screen will be shown during the boot
  - Enable the MDTP via one of the methods provided and finish the wizard
  - The device is now protected
2) Demo the factory reset protection
  - Make sure the MDTP was activated
  - Wipe the data partition
  - Reboot the device
  - Factory reset protection will be shown
  - At this point you can reboot the device multiple times and each time the protection screen will block the device boot
  - Disable MDTP via the wizard screen
  - Device boot continues as usual

Manual Wizard UI demo (will not require wipe / reboot):
-------------------------------------------------------

adb shell pm enable com.qualcomm.qti.securemsm.mdtp.MdtpDemo/.SetupWizardActivity
adb shell sync && sleep 1
adb shell am start -a  android.intent.action.MAIN com.qualcomm.qti.securemsm.mdtp.MdtpDemo/.SetupWizardActivity
(Note that after the wizard is completed it will disable itself again)

MdtpDemo Device Owner
=====================

Device Owner application can enforce different security policies on a device, manage the device's profiles and users, lock an activity to the screen, encrypt FS and more.
To apply a full screen lock on a device, the MdtpDemo must be set up and a Device Owner application first.

Enabling MdtpDemo as Device Owner on device:
--------------------------------------------

1) Create an xml file name device_owner.xml with the following content:

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes" ?>
	<device-owner package="com.qualcomm.qti.securemsm.mdtp.MdtpDemo" name="MdtpDemo" />

2) adb root
3) adb remount
4) adb push device_owner.xml /data/system/
5) adb reboot

MdtpDemo is now a Device Owner of the device.

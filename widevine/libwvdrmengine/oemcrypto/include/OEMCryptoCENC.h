/*
 * OEMCrypto_DestBufferDesc
 *  Describes the type and access information for the memory to receive
 *  decrypted data.
 *
 *  The OEMCrypto API supports a range of client device architectures.
 *  Different architectures have different methods for acquiring and securing
 *  buffers that will hold portions of the audio or video stream after
 *  decryption. Three basic strategies are recognized for handling decrypted
 *  stream data:
 *  1. Return the decrypted data in the clear into normal user memory
 *     (ClearBuffer). The caller uses normal memory allocation methods to
 *     acquire a buffer, and supplies the memory address of the buffer in the
 *     descriptor.
 *  2. Place the decrypted data into protected memory (SecureBuffer). The
 *     caller uses a platform-specific method to acquire the protected buffer
 *     and a user-memory handle that references it. The handle is supplied
 *     to the decrypt call in the descriptor.  If the buffer is filled with
 *     several OEMCrypto calls, the same handle will be used, and the offset
 *     will be incremented to indicate where the next write should take place.
 *  3. Place the decrypted data directly into the audio or video decoder fifo
 *     (Direct). The caller will use platform-specific methods to initialize
 *     the fifo and the decoders. The decrypted stream data is not accessible
 *     to the caller.
 *
 *  Specific fields are as follows:
 *
 *  (type == OEMCrypto_BufferType_Clear)
 *      address - Address of start of user memory buffer.
 *      max_length - Size of user memory buffer.
 *  (type == OEMCrypto_BufferType_Secure)
 *      buffer - handle to a platform-specific secure buffer.
 *      max_length - Size of platform-specific secure buffer.
 *      offset - offset from beginning of buffer to which OEMCrypto should write.
 *  (type == OEMCrypto_BufferType_Direct)
 *      is_video - If true, decrypted bytes are routed to the video
 *                 decoder. If false, decrypted bytes are routed to the
 *                 audio decoder.

 * OEMCrypto_GenerateDerivedKeys
 *
 * Description:
 *   Generates three secondary keys -- mac_key_server, mac_key_client, and
 *   encrypt_key -- for handling signing and content key decryption under the
 *   license server protocol for AES CTR mode.
 *
 *   Refer to document "Widevine Modular DRM Security Integration Guide for
 *   CENC" for details. This function computes the AES-128-CMAC of the
 *   enc_key_context and stores it in secure memory as the encrypt_key. It
 *   then computes four cycles of AES-128-CMAC of the mac_key_context and
 *   stores it in the mac_keys. The first two cycles are used for
 *   mac_key_server and the second two cycles are used for mac_key_client.
 *   These three keys will be stored until the next call to LoadKeys.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   session (in) - handle for the session to be used.
 *   mac_key_context (in) - pointer to memory containing context data for
 *                          computing the HMAC generation key.
 *   mac_key_context_length (in) - length of the HMAC key context data, in
 *                                 bytes.
 *   enc_key_context (in) - pointer to memory containing context data for
 *                          computing the encryption key.
 *   enc_key_context_length (in) - length of the encryption key context data, in
 *                                 bytes.
 *
 *
 * Results:
 *  mac_key_server: the 256 bit mac key is generated and stored in secure
 *  memory.
 *  mac_key_client: the 256 bit mac key is generated and stored in secure
 *  memory.
 *  enc_key: the 128 bit encryption key is generated and stored in secure

 *   for the next call to LoadKeys.
 *
 *   Because the nonce will be used to prevent replay attacks, it is desirable

 *   condition and generate valid nonces again.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   session (in) - crypto session identifier.
 *   nonce (out) - pointer to memory to received the computed nonce.
 *
 * Results:

/*
 * OEMCrypto_LoadKeys
 *
 * Description:
 *   Installs a set of keys for performing decryption in the current session.
 *
 *   The relevant fields have been extracted from the License Response protocol
 *   message, but the entire message and associated signature are provided so
 *   the message can be verified (using HMAC-SHA256 with the derived
 *   mac_key_server). If the signature verification fails, ignore all other
 *   arguments and return OEMCrypto_ERROR_SIGNATURE_FAILURE. Otherwise, add the
 *   keys to the session context.
 *
 *   The keys will be decrypted using the current encrypt_key (AES-128-CBC) and
 *   the IV given in the KeyObject. Each key control block will be decrypted
 *   using the first 128 bits of the corresponding content key (AES-128-CBC) and
 *   the IV given in the KeyObject.
 *
 *   If it is not null, enc_mac_keys will be used to create new mac_keys. After
 *   all keys have been decrypted and validated, the new mac_keys are decrypted
 *   with the current encrypt_key and the offered IV. The new mac_keys replaces
 *   the current mac_keys for future calls to OEMCrypto_RefreshKeys(). The first
 *   256 bits of the mac_keys become the mac_key[server] and the following 256
 *   bits of the mac_keys become the mac_key[client]. If enc_mac_keys is null,
 *   then there will not be a call to OEMCrypto_RefreshKeys for this session and
 *   the current mac_keys should remain unchanged.
 *
 *   The mac_key and encrypt_key were generated and stored by the previous call
 *   to OEMCrypto_GenerateDerivedKeys(). The nonce was generated and stored by
 *   the previous call to OEMCrypto_GenerateNonce().
 *
 *   This session’s elapsed time clock is started at 0. The clock will be used
 *   in OEMCrypto_DecryptCENC().
 *
 *   NOTE: The calling software must have previously established the mac_keys
 *   and encrypt_key with a call to OEMCrypto_GenerateDerivedKeys(),
 *   OEMCrypto_DeriveKeysFromSessionKey(), or a previous call to
 *   OEMCrypto_LoadKeys().
 *
 *   Refer to document "Widevine Modular DRM Security Integration Guide for
 *   CENC" for details.
 *
 *   If the parameter license_type is OEMCrypto_ContentLicense, then the fields
 *   key_id and key_data in an OEMCrypto_KeyObject are loaded in to the
 *   content_key_id and content_key_data fields of the key table entry.  In
 *   this case, entitlement key ids and entitlement key data is left blank.
 *
 *   If the parameter license_type is OEMCrypto_EntitlementLicense, then the
 *   fields key_id and key_data in an OEMCrypto_KeyObject are loaded in to the
 *   entitlement_key_id and entitlement_key_data fields of the key table entry.
 *   In this case, content key ids and content key data will be loaded later
 *   with a call to OEMCrypto_LoadEntitledContentKeys().
 *
 *   OEMCrypto may assume that the key_id_length is at most 16.  However,
 *   OEMCrypto shall correctly handle key id lengths from 1 to 16 bytes.
 *
 *   OEMCrypto shall handle at least 20 keys per session. This allows a
 *   single license to contain separate keys for 3 key rotations (previous
 *   interval, current interval, next interval) times 4 content keys (audio,
 *   SD, HD, UHD) plus up to 8 keys for watermarks.
 *
 * Verification:
 *   The following checks should be performed. If any check fails, an error is
 *   returned, and none of the keys are loaded.
 *
 *   1. The signature of the message shall be computed, and the API shall
 *   verify the computed signature matches the signature passed in. If not,
 *   return OEMCrypto_ERROR_SIGNATURE_FAILURE. The signature verification shall
 *   use a constant-time algorithm (a signature mismatch will always take the
 *   same time as a successful comparison).
 *
 *   2. The enc_mac_keys pointer must be either null, or point inside the
 *   message. If the pointer enc_mac_keys is not null, the API shall verify
 *   that the two pointers enc_mac_keys_iv and enc_mac_keys point to locations
 *   in the message. I.e. (message <= p && p < message+message_length)for p in
 *   each of enc_mac_keys_iv, enc_mac_keys. If not, return
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT.
 *
 *   3. The API shall verify that each pointer in each KeyObject points to a
 *   location in the message. I.e. (message <= p && p < message+message_length)
 *   for p in each of key_id, key_data_iv, key_data, key_control_iv,
 *   key_control. If not, return OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT.
 *
 *   4. Each key’s control block, after decryption, shall have a valid
 *   verification field. If not, return OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT.
 *
 *   5. If any key control block has the Nonce_Enabled bit set, that key’s Nonce
 *   field shall match the nonce generated by the current nonce. If not, return
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_NONCE. If there is a match, remove that nonce from
 *   the cache. Note that all the key control blocks in a particular call shall
 *   have the same nonce value.
 *
 *   6. If any key control block has the Require_AntiRollback_Hardware bit set,
 *   and the device does not protect the usage table from rollback, then do not
 *   load the keys and return OEMCrypto_ERROR_UNKNOWN_FAILURE.
 *
 *   7. If the key control block has a nonzero Replay_Control, then the
 *   verification described below is also performed.
 *
 *   8. If num_keys == 0, then return OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT.
 *
 *   Usage Table and Provider Session Token (pst):
 *
 *   If a key control block has a nonzero value for Replay_Control, then all
 *   keys in this license will have the same value. In this case, the following
 *   additional checks are performed.
 *
 *   The pointer pst must not be null, and must point to a location in the
 *   message. If not, return OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT.
 *
 *   - If Replay_Control is 1 = Nonce_Required, then OEMCrypto will perform a
 *     nonce check as described above. OEMCrypto will verify that the table
 *     does not already have an entry for the value of pst passed in as a
 *     parameter.  If an entry already exists, an error
 *     OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT is returned and no keys are
 *     loaded. OEMCrypto will then create a new entry in the table, and mark
 *     this session as using this new entry. This prevents the license from
 *     being loaded more than once, and will be used for online streaming.
 *
 *   - If Replay_Control is 2 = "Require existing Session Usage table entry or
 *     Nonce", then OEMCrypto will check the Session Usage table for an existing
 *     entry with the same pst.
 *
 *   --- If the pst is not in the table yet, a new entry will be created in the
 *       table and this session shall use the new entry. In that case, the nonce
 *       will be verified for each key.
 *
 *   --- If an existing usage table entry is found, then this session will use
 *       that entry. In that case, the nonce will not be verified for each key.
 *       Also, the entry’s mac keys will be verified against the current
 *       session’s mac keys. This allows an offline license to be reloaded but
 *       maintain continuity of the playback times from one session to the next.
 *
 *   - If the nonce is not valid and an existing entry is not found, the return
 *     error is OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_NONCE.
 *
 *   Note: If LoadKeys updates the mac keys, then the new updated mac keys will
 *   be used in the Usage Table. If LoadKeys does not update the mac keys, the
 *   existing session mac keys are stored in the usage table.
 *
 *   Sessions that are associated with an entry will need to be able to update
 *   and verify the status of the entry, and the time stamps in the entry.
 *
 *   Devices that do not support the Usage Table will return
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT if the Replay_Control is nonzero.
 *
 *   Note: If LoadKeys creates a new entry in the usage table, OEMCrypto will
 *   increment the Usage Table’s generation number, and then sign, encrypt, and
 *   save the Usage Table.
 *

 *   session (in) - crypto session identifier.

 * OEMCrypto_QueryKeyControl
 *
 * Description:
 *   Returns the decrypted key control block for the given key_id. This function
 *   is for application developers to debug license server and key timelines.
 *   It only returns a key control block if LoadKeys was successful, otherwise
 *   it returns OEMCrypto_ERROR_NO_CONTENT_KEY. The developer of the OEMCrypto
 *   library must be careful that the keys themselves are not accidentally
 *   revealed.
 *
 * Note:
 *   Returns control block in original, network byte order. If OEMCrypto
 *   converts fields to host byte order internally for storage, it should
 *   convert them back. Since OEMCrypto might not store the nonce or validation
 *   fields, values of 0 may be used instead.
 *
 * Verification
 *   The following checks should be performed.
 *   1) If key_id is null, return OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT.
 *   2) If key_control_block_length is null, return
 *      OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT.
 *   3) If *key_control_block_length is less than the length of a key control
 *      block, set it to the correct value, and return
 *      OEMCrypto_ERROR_SHORT_BUFFER.
 *   4) If key_control_block is null, return OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT.
 *   5) If the specified key has not been loaded, return
 *      OEMCrypto_ERROR_NO_CONTENT_KEY.
 *
 * Parameters
 *   content_key_id (in) - The unique id of the content key of interest.

 * OEMCrypto_SelectKey
 *
 * Description:
 *   Select a content key and install it in the hardware key ladder for
 *   subsequent decryption operations (OEMCrypto_DecryptCENC()) for this
 *   session.  The specified key must have been previously "installed" via
 *   OEMCrypto_LoadKeys() or OEMCrypto_RefreshKeys().
 *
 *   A key control block is associated with the key and the session, and is used
 *   to configure the session context. The Key Control data is documented in
 *   "Key Control Block Definition".
 *
 *   Step 1: Lookup the content key data via the offered key_id. The key data
 *   includes the key value, and the key control block.
 *
 *   Step 2: Latch the content key into the hardware key ladder. Set
 *           permission flags and timers based on the key's control block.
 *
 *   Step 3: use the latched content key to decrypt (AES-128-CTR) buffers
 *           passed in via OEMCrypto_DecryptCENC(). If the key is 256 bits it
 *           will be used for OEMCrypto_Generic_Sign or
 *           OEMCrypto_Generic_Verify as specified in the key control block.
 *           If the key will be used with OEMCrypto_Generic_Encrypt or
 *           OEMCrypto_Generic_Decrypt, the cipher mode will always be
 *           OEMCrypto_CipherMode_CBC. Continue to use this key until
 *           OEMCrypto_SelectKey() is called again, or until
 *           OEMCrypto_CloseSession() is called.
 *
 * Verification:
 *   The following checks should be performed if is_encrypted is true. If any
 *   check fails, an error is returned, and no decryption is performed.
 *
 *   1.  If the key id is not found in the keytable for this session, then the
 *   key state is not changed and OEMCrypto shall return
 *   OEMCrypto_KEY_NOT_LOADED.
 *
 *   2. If the current key's control block has a nonzero Duration field, then
 *   the API shall verify that the duration is greater than the session's
 *   elapsed time clock before the key is used.  OEMCrypto may return
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_KEY_EXPIRED from OEMCrypto_SelectKey, or SelectKey may
 *   return success from select key and the decrypt or generic crypto call will
 *   return OEMCrypto_ERROR_KEY_EXPIRED.
 *
 *   3. If the key control block has the bit Disable_Analog_Output set, then
 *   the device should disable analog video output.  If the device has analog
 *   output that cannot be disabled, then the key is not selected, and
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_ANALOG_OUTPUT is returned.
 *
 *   4. If the key control block has HDCP required, and the device cannot
 *   enforce HDCP, then the key is not selected, and
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_HDCP is returned.
 *
 *   5. If the key control block has a nonzero value for HDCP_Version, and the
 *   device cannot enforce at least that version of HDCP, then the key is not
 *   selected, and OEMCrypto_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_HDCP is returned.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *    session (in) - crypto session identifier
 *    content_key_id (in) - pointer to the Content Key ID
 *    content_key_id_length (in) - length of the Key ID in bytes. From 1 to 16
 *                         inclusive.
 *    cipher_mode (in) - whether the key should be prepared for CTR mode or CBC
 *                       mode when used in later calls to DecryptCENC. This
 *                       should be ignored when the key is used for Generic Crypto calls.
 *
 * Threading:
 *   This function may be called simultaneously with functions on other
 *   sessions, but not with other functions on this session.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   OEMCrypto_SUCCESS success
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_SESSION crypto session ID invalid or not open
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_NO_DEVICE_KEY failed to decrypt device key
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_NO_CONTENT_KEY failed to decrypt content key

/*
 * OEMCrypto_DecryptCENC
 *
 * Description:
 *   Decrypts or copies the payload in the buffer referenced by the *data_addr
 *   parameter into the buffer referenced by the out_buffer parameter, using
 *   the session context indicated by the session parameter. Decryption mode
 *   is AES-128-CTR or AES-128-CBC depending on the value of cipher_mode set in
 *   the OEMCrypto_KeyObject passed in to OEMCrypto_LoadKeys. If is_encrypted
 *   is true, the content key associated with the session is latched in the
 *   active hardware key ladder and is used for the decryption operation. If
 *   is_encrypted is false, the data is simply copied.
 *
 *   After decryption, the data_length bytes are copied to the location
 *   described by out_buffer. This could be one of
 *
 *   1. The structure out_buffer contains a pointer to a clear text buffer. The
 *   OEMCrypto library shall verify that key control allows data to be returned
 *   in clear text. If it is not authorized, this method should return an
 *   error.
 *
 *   2. The structure out_buffer contains a handle to a secure buffer.
 *
 *   3. The structure out_buffer indicates that the data should be sent
 *   directly to the decoder and rendered.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *   For CTR mode, IV points to the counter value to be used for the initial
 *   encrypted block of the input buffer. The IV length is the AES block
 *   size. For subsequent encrypted AES blocks the IV is calculated by
 *   incrementing the lower 64 bits (byte 8-15) of the IV value used for the
 *   previous block. The counter rolls over to zero when it reaches its maximum
 *   value (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF). The upper 64 bits (byte 0-7) of the IV do not
 *   change.
 *
 *   For CBC mode, IV points to the initialization vector for cipher block
 *   chaining. Within each subsample, OEMCrypto is responsible for updating
 *   the IV as prescribed by CBC mode. The calling layer above is responsible
 *   for updating the IV from one subsample to the next if needed.
 *
 *   This method may be called several times before the decrypted data is used.
 *   For this reason, the parameter subsample_flags may be used to optimize
 *   decryption. The first buffer in a chunk of data will have the
 *   OEMCrypto_FirstSubsample bit set in subsample_flags. The last buffer in a
 *   chunk of data will have the OEMCrypto_LastSubsample bit set in
 *   subsample_flags. The decrypted data will not be used until after
 *   OEMCrypto_LastSubsample has been set. If an implementation decrypts data
 *   immediately, it may ignore subsample_flags.
 *
 *   If the destination buffer is secure, an offset may be specified.
 *   DecryptCENC begins storing data out_buffer->secure.offset bytes after the
 *   beginning of the secure buffer.
 *
 *   If the session has an entry in the Usage Table, then OEMCrypto will update
 *   the time_of_last_decrypt. If the status of the entry is "unused", then
 *   change the status to "active" and set the time_of_first_decrypt.
 *
 *   The decryption mode, either OEMCrypto_CipherMode_CTR or
 *   OEMCrypto_CipherMode_CBC, was specified in the call to OEMCrypto_SelectKey.
 *   The encryption pattern is specified by the fields in the parameter
 *   pattern. A description of partial encryption patterns can be found in the
 *   document Draft International Standard ISO/IEC DIS 23001-7. Search for the
 *   codes "cenc", "cbc1", "cens" or "cbcs".
 *
 *   The most common mode is "cenc", which is OEMCrypto_CipherMode_CTR without
 *   a pattern. The entire subsample is either encrypted or clear, depending
 *   on the flag is_encrypted. In the structure pattern, both encrypt and skip
 *   will be 0. This is the only mode that allows for a nonzero block_offset.
 *
 *   A less common mode is "cens", which is OEMCrypto_CipherMode_CTR with an
 *   encryption pattern. For this mode, OEMCrypto may assume that an encrypted
 *   subsample will have a length that is a multiple of 16, the AES block
 *   length.
 *
 *   The mode "cbc1" is OEMCrypto_CipherMode_CBC without a pattern. In the
 *   structure pattern, both encrypt and skip will be 0. If an encrypted
 *   subsample has a length that is not a multiple of 16, the final partial
 *   block will be in the clear.
 *
 *   The mode "cbcs" is OEMCrypto_CipherMode_CBC with an encryption pattern.
 *   This mode allows devices to decrypt HLS content. If an encrypted
 *   subsample has a length that is not a multiple of 16, the final partial
 *   block will be in the clear.
 *
 *   A sample may be broken up into a mix of clear and encrypted subsamples. In
 *   order to support the VP9 standard, the breakup of a subsample into clear
 *   and encrypted subsamples is not always in pairs.
 *
 * Verification:
 *   The following checks should be performed if is_encrypted is true. If any
 *   check fails, an error is returned, and no decryption is performed.
 *
 *   1. If the current key’s control block has a nonzero Duration field, then
 *   the API shall verify that the duration is greater than the session’s
 *   elapsed time clock. If not, return OEMCrypto_ERROR_KEY_EXPIRED.
 *
 *   2. If the current key’s control block has the Data_Path_Type bit set, then
 *   the API shall verify that the output buffer is secure or direct. If not,
 *   return OEMCrypto_ERROR_DECRYPT_FAILED.
 *
 *   3. If the current key control block has the bit Disable_Analog_Output set,
 *   then the device should disable analog video output.  If the device has
 *   analog output that cannot be disabled, then the key is not selected, and
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_ANALOG_OUTPUT is returned.
 *
 *   4. If the current key’s control block has the HDCP bit set, then the API
 *   shall verify that the buffer will be output using HDCP only. If not,
 *   return OEMCrypto_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_HDCP.
 *
 *   4. If the current key’s control block has a nonzero value for
 *   HDCP_Version, then the current version of HDCP for the device and the
 *   display combined will be compared against the version specified in the
 *   control block. If the current version is not at least as high as that in
 *   the control block, then return OEMCrypto_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_HDCP.
 *
 *   5.  If the current session has an entry in the Usage Table, and the status
 *   of that entry is either kInactiveUsed or kInactiveUnused, then return the
 *   error OEMCrypto_ERROR_LICENSE_INACTIVE.
 *
 *   If the flag is_encrypted is false, then no verification is performed. This
 *   call shall copy clear data even when there are no keys loaded, or there is
 *   no selected key.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   session (in) - crypto session identifier.
 *   data_addr (in) - An unaligned pointer to this segment of the stream.
 *   data_length (in) - The length of this segment of the stream, in bytes.
 *   is_encrypted (in) - True if the buffer described by data_addr, data_length
 *                       is encrypted. If is_encrypted is false, only the
 *                       data_addr and data_length parameters are used. The iv
 *                       and offset arguments are ignored.
 *   iv (in) - The initial value block to be used for content decryption.
 *   block_offset (in) - If non-zero, the decryption block boundary is
 *                       different from the start of the data. block_offset
 *                       should be subtracted from data_addr to compute the
 *                       starting address of the first decrypted block. The
 *                       bytes between the decryption block start address and
 *                       data_addr are discarded after decryption. It does not
 *                       adjust the beginning of the source or destination
 *                       data. This parameter satisfies 0 <= block_offset <
 *                       16. This paramater is only used for CTR mode.
 *   out_buffer (in) - A caller-owned descriptor that specifies the handling of
 *                     the decrypted byte stream. See OEMCrypto_DestbufferDesc
 *                     for details.
 *   pattern (in) - A caller-owned structure indicating the encrypt/skip
 *                  pattern as specified in the CENC standard.
 *   subsample_flags (in) - bitwise flags indicating if this is the first,

 * OEMCrypto_WrapRootKeyCertificate
 *
 * Description:
 *
 *   A device should be provisioned at the factory with either an OEM

 *   manufacturing, the root of trust should be encrypted with the OEM root key
 *   and stored on the file system in a region that will not be erased during

 *   the Widevine DRM plugin initializes, it will look for a wrapped root of
 *   trust in the file /factory/wv.keys and install it into the security
 *   processor by calling OEMCrypto_InstallRootKeyCertificate().
 *
 *   OEMCrypto_WrapRootKeyCertificate() is used to generate an OEM-encrypted
 *   root of trust that may be passed to OEMCrypto_InstallRootKeyCertificate()
 *   for provisioning.  The root of trust may be either passed in the clear or
 *   previously encrypted with a transport key.  If a transport key is supplied,
 *   the keybox is first decrypted with the transport key before being wrapped
 *   with the OEM root key.  This function is only needed if the root of trust
 *   provisioning method involves saving the keybox to the file system.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   rot (in) - pointer to root of trust data to encrypt. May be NULL on the
 *       first call to test size of wrapped keybox. The keybox may either be
 *       clear or previously encrypted.
 *   rotLength (in) - length the rot data in bytes
 *   wrappedRot (out) – Pointer to wrapped rot
 *   wrappedRotLength (out) – Pointer to the length of the wrapped keybox in
 *       bytes
 *   transportKey (in) – Optional. AES transport key. If provided, the rot
 *       parameter was previously encrypted with this key. The rot will be

 * OEMCrypto_RewrapDeviceRSAKey30
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is similar to RewrapDeviceRSAKey, except it uses the private
 *   key from an OEM certificate to decrypt the message key instead of keys
 *   derived from a keybox. Verifies an RSA provisioning response is valid and
 *   corresponds to the previous provisioning request by checking the nonce.
 *   The RSA private key is decrypted and stored in secure memory. The RSA key
 *   is then re-encrypted and signed for storage on the filesystem. We
 *   recommend that the OEM use an encryption key and signing key generated
 *   using an algorithm at least as strong as that in GenerateDerivedKeys.
 *
 *   After decrypting enc_rsa_key, If the first four bytes of the buffer are
 *   the string “SIGN”, then the actual RSA key begins on the 9th byte of the
 *   buffer. The second four bytes of the buffer is the 32 bit field
 *   “allowed_schemes”, of type RSA_Padding_Scheme, which is used in
 *   OEMCrypto_GenerateRSASignature. The value of allowed_schemes must also
 *   be wrapped with RSA key. We recommend storing the magic string “SIGN” with
 *   the key to distinguish keys that have a value for allowed_schemes from
 *   those that should use the default allowed_schemes. Devices that do not
 *   support the alternative signing algorithms may refuse to load these keys
 *   and return an error of OEMCrypto_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED. The main use case
 *   for these alternative signing algorithms is to support devices that use
 *   x509 certificates for authentication when acting as a ChromeCast receiver.
 *   This is not needed for devices that wish to send data to a ChromeCast.
 *
 *   If the first four bytes of the buffer enc_rsa_key are not the string
 *   “SIGN”, then the default value of allowed_schemes = 1 (kSign_RSASSA_PSS)
 *   will be used.
 *
 * Verification and Algorithm:
 *   The following checks should be performed. If any check fails, an error is
 *   returned, and the key is not loaded.
 *  1. Verify that in_wrapped_rsa_key_length is large enough to hold the
 *   rewrapped key, returning OEMCrypto_ERROR_SHORT_BUFFER otherwise.
 *  2. Verify that the nonce matches one generated by a previous call to
 *   OEMCrypto_GenerateNonce(). The matching nonce shall be removed from the
 *   nonce table. If there is no matching nonce, return
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_NONCE.
 *  3. Decrypt encrypted_message_key with the OEM certificate’s private RSA key
 *   using RSA-OAEP into the buffer message_key. This message key is a 128 bit
 *   AES key used only in step 4. This message_key should be kept in secure
 *   memory and protected from the user.
 *  4. Decrypt enc_rsa_key into the buffer rsa_key using the message_key, which
 *   was found in step 3. Use enc_rsa_key_iv as the initial vector for
 *   AES_128-CBC mode, with PKCS#5 padding. The rsa_key should be kept in
 *   secure memory and protected from the user.
 *  5. If the first four bytes of the buffer rsa_key are the string “SIGN”,
 *   then the  actual RSA key begins on the 9th byte of the buffer. The second
 *   four bytes of the buffer is the 32 bit field “allowed_schemes”, of type
 *   RSA_Padding_Scheme, which is used in OEMCrypto_GenerateRSASignature.
 *   The value of allowed_schemes must also be wrapped with RSA key. We
 *   recommend storing the magic string “SIGN” with the key to distinguish keys
 *   that have a value for allowed_schemes from those that should use the
 *   default allowed_schemes. Devices that do not support the alternative
 *   signing algorithms may refuse to load these keys and return an error of

 *   signing algorithms is to support devices that use X.509 certificates for
 *   authentication when acting as a ChromeCast receiver. This is not needed
 *   for devices that wish to send data to a ChromeCast.
 *  6. If the first four bytes of the buffer rsa_key are not the string “SIGN”,
 *   then the default value of allowed_schemes = 1 (kSign_RSASSA_PSS) will be
 *   used.
 *  7. After possibly skipping past the first 8 bytes signifying the allowed
 *   signing algorithm, the rest of the buffer rsa_key contains an RSA device
 *   key in PKCS#8 binary DER encoded format. The OEMCrypto library shall
 *   verify that this RSA key is valid.
 *  8. Re-encrypt the device RSA key with an internal key (such as the OEM key
 *   or Widevine Keybox key) and the generated IV using AES-128-CBC with PKCS#5
 *   padding.
 *  9. Copy the rewrapped key to the buffer specified by wrapped_rsa_key and
 *   the size of the wrapped key to wrapped_rsa_key_length.

/*
 * OEMCrypto_GenerateRSASignature
 *
 * Description:
 *   The OEMCrypto_GenerateRSASignature method is used to sign messages using
 *   the device private RSA key, specifically, it is used to sign the initial
 *   license request. Refer to the License Request Signed by RSA Certificate
 *   section above for more details.
 *
 *   If this function is called after OEMCrypto_LoadDeviceRSAKey for the same
 *   session, then this function should use the device RSA key that was loaded.
 *   If this function is called after a call to
 *   OEMCrypto_GetOEMPublicCertificate for the same session, then this function
 *   should use the RSA private key associated with the OEM certificate. The
 *   only padding scheme that is valid for the OEM certificate is
 *   0x1 - RSASSA-PSS with SHA1. Any other padding scheme must generate an
 *   error.
 *
 *   For devices that wish to be CAST receivers, there is a new RSA padding
 *   scheme.  The padding_scheme parameter indicates which hashing and padding
 *   is to be applied to the message so as to generate the encoded message (the
 *   modulus-sized block to which the integer conversion and RSA decryption is
 *   applied). The following values are defined:
 *   0x1 - RSASSA-PSS with SHA1.
 *   0x2 - PKCS1 with block type 1 padding (only).
 *
 *   In the first case, a hash algorithm (SHA1) is first applied to the
 *   message, whose length is not otherwise restricted. In the second case, the
 *   "message" is already a digest, so no further hashing is applied, and the
 *   message_length can be no longer than 83 bytes. If the message_length is
 *   greater than 83 bytes OEMCrypto_ERROR_SIGNATURE_FAILURE shall be returned.
 *
 *   The second padding scheme is for devices that use x509 certificates for
 *   authentication. The main example is devices that work as a Cast receiver,
 *   like a ChromeCast, not for devices that wish to send to the Cast device,
 *   such as almost all Android devices. OEMs that do not support x509
 *   certificate authentication need not implement the second scheme and can
 *   return OEMCrypto_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
 *
 * Verification:
 *   The bitwise AND of the parameter padding_scheme and the RSA key’s
 *   allowed_schemes is computed. If this value is 0, then the signature is not
 *   computed and the error OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_RSA_KEY is returned.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   session (in)              - crypto session identifier.
 *   message (in)              - pointer to memory containing message to be
 *                             - signed.
 *   message_length (in)       - length of the message, in bytes.
 *   signature (out)           - buffer to hold the message signature. On
 *                             - return, it will contain the message signature
 *                             - generated with the device private RSA key using
 *                             - RSASSA-PSS.
 *   signature_length (in/out) - (in) length of the signature buffer, in bytes.
 *                             - (out) actual length of the signature
 *   padding_scheme (in) - specify which scheme to use for the signature.
 *
 * Threading:
 *   This function may be called simultaneously with functions on other
 *   sessions, but not with other functions on this session.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   OEMCrypto_SUCCESS success
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_SESSION
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_SHORT_BUFFER if the signature buffer is too small.
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_RSA_KEY

 *
 *   This function is similar to OEMCrypto_GenerateDerivedKeys, except that it

 *   before use. Once the enc_key and mac_keys have been generated, all calls
 *   to LoadKeys and RefreshKeys proceed in the same manner for license
 *   requests using RSA or using a Widevine keybox token.
 *
 * Verification:
 *   If the RSA key’s allowed_schemes is not kSign_RSASSA_PSS, then no keys are
 *   derived and the error OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_RSA_KEY is returned. An RSA
 *   key cannot be used for both deriving session keys and also for PKCS1

 * OEMCrypto_Generic_Verify
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function verifies the signature of a generic buffer of data using the
 *   current key.
 *
 *   If the session has an entry in the Usage Table, then OEMCrypto will update
 *   the time_of_last_decrypt. If the status of the entry is "unused", then
 *   change the status to "active" and set the time_of_first_decrypt.
 *
 * Verification:
 *   The following checks should be performed. If any check fails, an error is
 *   returned.
 *   1. The control bit for the current key shall have the Allow_Verify set.
 *   2. The signature of the message shall be computed, and the API shall verify
 *   the computed signature matches the signature passed in. If not, return
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_SIGNATURE_FAILURE.
 *   3. The signature verification shall use a constant-time algorithm (a
 *   signature mismatch will always take the same time as a successful
 *   comparison).
 *   4. If the current key’s control block has a nonzero Duration field, then
 *   the API shall verify that the duration is greater than the session’s
 *   elapsed time clock. If not, return OEMCrypto_ERROR_KEY_EXPIRED.
 *   5. If the current session has an entry in the Usage Table, and the status
 *   of that entry is "inactive", then return OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_SESSION.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   session (in) - crypto session identifier.
 *   in_buffer (in) - pointer to memory containing data to be encrypted.
 *   buffer_length (in) - length of the buffer, in bytes.
 *   algorithm (in) - Specifies which algorithm to use.
 *   signature (in) - pointer to buffer in which signature resides.
 *   signature_length (in) - length of the signature buffer, in bytes.
 *
 * Threading:
 *   This function may be called simultaneously with functions on other
 *   sessions, but not with other functions on this session.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   OEMCrypto_SUCCESS success
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_KEY_EXPIRED
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_SIGNATURE_FAILURE
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_NO_DEVICE_KEY

 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED
 *
 * Buffer Sizes
 *   OEMCrypto shall support buffer sizes of at least 100 KiB for generic
 *   crypto operations.
 *   OEMCrypto shall return OEMCrypto_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_LARGE if the buffer is
 *   larger than the supported size.
 *
 * Version:

 *
 *   Devices that do not implement a Session Usage Table may return

 *
 * Parameters:

 *   pst (in) - pointer to memory containing Provider Session Token.
 *   pst_length (in) - length of the pst, in bytes.
 *
 * Threading:

 * OEMCrypto_ReportUsage
 *
 * Description:
 *   If the buffer_length is not sufficient to hold a report structure, set
 *   buffer_length and return OEMCrypto_ERROR_SHORT_BUFFER.
 *
 *   If the an entry was not loaded or created with
 *   OEMCrypto_CreateNewUsageEntry or OEMCrypto_LoadUsageEntry, or if the pst
 *   does not match that in the entry, return the error
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT.
 *
 *   If the usage entry’s flag ForbidReport is set, indicating the entry has
 *   not been saved since the entry was deactivated, then the error
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_ENTRY_NEEDS_UPDATE is returned and a report is not
 *   generated.  Similarly, if any key in the session has been used since the
 *   last call to OEMCrypto_UpdateUsageEntry, then the report is not generated,
 *   and OEMCrypto returns  the error OEMCrypto_ERROR_ENTRY_NEEDS_UPDATE.
 *
 *   The pst_report is filled out by subtracting the times in the Usage Entry
 *   from the current time on the secure clock.  This is done in case the
 *   secure clock is not using UTC time, but is instead using something like
 *   seconds since clock installed.
 *
 *   Valid values for status are:
 *     0 = kUnused -- the keys have not been used to decrypt.
 *     1 = kActive -- the keys have been used, and have not been deactivated.
 *     2 = kInactive -- deprecated.  Use kInactiveUsed or kInactiveUnused.
 *     3 = kInactiveUsed -- the keys have been marked inactive after a decrypt.
 *     4 = kInactiveUnused -- the keys have been marked inactive, no decrypt.
 *
 *   The clock_security_level is reported as follows:
 *     0 = Insecure Clock - clock just uses system time.
 *     1 = Secure Timer - clock uses secure timer, which cannot be modified by
 *     user software, when OEMCrypto is active and the system time when
 *     OEMCrypto is inactive.
 *     2 = Software Secure Clock - clock cannot be modified by user software
 *     when OEMCrypto is active or inactive.
 *     3 = Hardware Secure Clock - clock cannot be modified by user software
 *     and there are security features that prevent the user from modifying the
 *     clock in hardware, such as a tamper proof battery.
 *
 *   After pst_report has been filled in, the HMAC SHA1 signature is computed
 *   for the buffer from bytes 20 to the end of the pst field. The signature is
 *   computed using the client_mac_key which is stored in the usage table. The
 *   HMAC SHA1 signature is used to prevent a rogue application from using
 *   OMECrypto_GenerateSignature to forge a Usage Report.
 *
 *   This function also copies the client_mac_key and server_mac_key from the
 *   Usage Table entry to the session. They will be used to verify a signature
 *   in OEMCrypto_DeleteUsageEntry below. This session will be associated with
 *   the entry in the Usage Table.
 *
 *   Devices that do not implement a Session Usage Table may return
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   session (in) - handle for the session to be used.
 *   pst (in) - pointer to memory containing Provider Session Token.
 *   pst_length (in) - length of the pst, in bytes.
 *   buffer (out) - pointer to buffer in which usage report should be
 *   stored. May be null on the first call in order to find required buffer
 *   size.
 *   buffer_length (in/out) - (in) length of the report buffer, in bytes.
 *                           (out) actual length of the report
 *
 * Threading:
 *   This function will not be called simultaneously with any session functions.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   OEMCrypto_SUCCESS success
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_SHORT_BUFFER if report buffer is not large enough to hold
 *   the output report.
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_SESSION no open session with that id.
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED

 *   into the header_buffer.  Some actions, such as the first decrypt and
 *   deactivating an entry, will also increment the entry’s generation number
 *   as well as changing the entry’s status and time fields.   As in OEMCrypto
 *   v12, the first decryption will change the status from Inactive to Active,

 *
 *   If the usage entry has the flag ForbidReport set, then the flag is

/*
 * OEMCrypto_ShrinkUsageTableHeader
 *
 * Description:
 *   This shrinks the usage table and the header.  This function is used by the
 *   CDM layer after it has  defragmented the usage table and can delete unused
 *   entries.  It is an error if any open session is associated with an entry
 *   that will be erased.   If new_table_size is larger than the current size,
 *   then the header is not changed and the error is returned.  If the header
 *   has not been previously loaded, then an error is returned.  OEMCrypto will
 *   increment the master generation number in the header and store the new
 *   value in secure persistent storage.  Then, OEMCrypto will encrypt and sign
 *   the header into the provided buffer.  The generation numbers of all
 *   remaining entries will remain unchanged. The next time
 *   OEMCrypto_CreateNewUsageEntry is called, the new entry will have an index
 *   of new_table_size.
 *
 *   Devices that do not implement a Session Usage Table may return
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
 *
 *   If header_buffer_length is not large enough to hold the new table, it is
 *   set to the needed value, the generation number is not  incremented, and
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_SHORT_BUFFER is returned.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  [in] new_entry_count: number of entries in the to be in the header.
 *  [out] header_buffer: pointer to memory where encrypted usage table header
 *  is written.
 *  [in/out] header_buffer_length: (in) length of the header_buffer, in bytes.
 *                                 (out) actual length of the header_buffer
 *
 * Threading:
 *   This function will not be called simultaneously with any session functions.

 * OEMCrypto_MoveEntry
 *
 * Description: Moves the entry associated with the current session from one
 *   location in the usage table header to another.  This function is used by
 *   the CDM layer to defragment the usage table. This does not modify any data
 *   in the entry, except the index and the generation number.  The index in
 *   the session’s usage entry will be changed to new_index.  The generation
 *   number in session’s usage entry and in the header for new_index will be
 *   increased to the master generation number, and then the master generation
 *   number is incremented. If there was an existing entry at the new location,
 *   it will be overwritten.  It is an error to call this when the entry that
 *   was at new_index is associated with a currently open session.  In this
 *   case, the error code OEMCrypto_ERROR_ENTRY_IN_USE is returned. It is the
 *   CDM layer’s responsibility to call UpdateUsageEntry after moving an entry.
 *   It is an error for new_index to be beyond the end of the existing usage
 *   table header.
 *
 *   Devices that do not implement a Session Usage Table may return
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   [in] session: handle for the session to be used.
 *   [in] new_index: new index to be used for the session’s usage entry

 * OEMCrypto_CopyOldUsageEntry
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function copies an entry from the old v12 table to the new table.
 *   The new entry will already have been loaded by CreateNewUsageEntry.  If
 *   the device did not support pre-v13 usage tables, this may return
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
 *
 *   This is only needed for devices that are upgrading from a previous version
 *   of OEMCrypto to v13.  Devices that have an existing usage table with
 *   customer’s offline licenses will use this method to move entries from the
 *   old table to the new one.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  [in] session: handle for the session to be used.
 *  [in] pst: pointer to memory containing Provider Session Token.
 *  [in] pst_length: length of the pst, in bytes.
 *
 * Threading:
